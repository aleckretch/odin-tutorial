# odin-tutorial
An interactive introduction to the Odin information extraction system


# Requirements

You'll need Java 8, python, and the package listed in `requirements.txt`.

## Setting up your python environment

I recommend using a `conda` environment, though it isn't required.

`py-processors` (the dependency of this tutorial) is compatible with either  python 3 (recommended) or python 2.7.x.
```
conda create -n odin python=3
source activate odin
```

Install the python dependencies with the following command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Running the notebooks

```
jupyter notebook
```
